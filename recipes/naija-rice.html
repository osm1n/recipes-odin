    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Nigerian Fried Rice</strong> is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version relies on a
         ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil for crisping it up.
        <em>Everyone agrees that it taste better than Ghanian Fried Rice</em> </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock </li>
        <li>3 tbsp oil for frying </li>
        <li>1 cup onion diced </li>
        <li>1 cup mixed Vegetables Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn and green beans</li>
        <li>1 tsp Curry powder </li>
        <li>2 scallions diced</li>
        <li>1 chicken stock cube</li>
        <li>1 cup beef liver cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It’s ok to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat!</li>
        <li><p>Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, 
            otherwise, you will end up with soggy fried rice.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</p></li>
        <li><p>I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn, and Green Beans. 
            However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers can also be used.</p></li>
        <li><p>In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn up the heat to 
            high during the frying process and stir continuously as you allow the rice to heat up.</p></li>
        <li><p>I added pieces of beef liver to my fried Rice, a lot of people like this as well, but if you don’t want it 
            you are free to leave it out, you will still enjoy the total goodness of the Fried Rice.</p></li>
        <li><p>When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or Turkey stock because of their mild taste. 
            The beef stock should be avoided as it can overpower the taste of the fried rice.</p></li>
    </ul>
